Variables
=========

The file mumbai2014.csv contains results from Maharashtra's 2014
assembly polls on booth level (AC 152 to AC 187, i.e. greater Mumbai),
better known as "Form 20" results. For each booth / candidate it lists:

pc:          parliamentary constituency code
pc_name:     parliamentary constituency name
ac:          assembly segment code
ac_name:     assembly segment name
ac_reserved: assembly segment reservation status
booth:       polling booth code
candidate:   candidate name
party:       party name
symbol:      allotted symbol
votes:       number of votes polled

Moreover, there are five "fake" candidate names in each booth:

valid:       number of valid votes
rejected:    number of rejected votes
nota:        how often 'None of The Above' was chosen 
total:       total number of votes
tendered:    number of tendered votes

Sources
=======

The source PDF files were downloaded from on January 16, 2016, from 

https://ceo.maharashtra.gov.in/form20/AC2014/AC_XXX.pdf (XXX = AC id)

The candidate-to-party mapping was done based on

http://ceo.maharashtra.gov.in/Downloads%5CAC2014%5CCandidatelistfinal.pdf

Problems
========

ACs 154, 166, 182 and 185: raw files unavailable

ACs 169, 178 and 183: raw files are scans, hence not crawlable

Also note that the party names and symbols column is garbled at
times because of a pdftotext limitation. Candidate names are generally
not as affected and I have cleaned it up for the major relevant parties 
in this election, namely BJP, Shiv Sena, Congress, MNS, NCP and MIM. 
But be warned that smaller parties / independents might be garbled 
(they can pretty easily be made out, though).

Script
======

The perl script used to extract data from raw PDFs is attached for
educational purposes - it has a few hardcoded paths in there, so don't
expect it to run out of the box.

Contact

Should you have any questions about these files, or be interested in
the same data for the whole of Maharashtra (which I have downloaded
but not cleaned up and hence not shared), feel free to get in touch:
