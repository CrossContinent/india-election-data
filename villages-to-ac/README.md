# Census village / Assembly segment matching

This conversion table lists Census villages (using 2001 codes) to the assembly segment they fall into (using post-delimitation codes). It was generated using spatial matching of a proprietary point cloud of village locations to proprietary polygon shapefiles of assembly segment boundaries. 

Original data came from ML Infomap, and while the proprietary license allows the distribution of derivative datasets (such as this table), it prohibits commercial re-use. Consequently, this matching table is published under a CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0 license.
